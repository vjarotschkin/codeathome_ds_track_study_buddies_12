Happiness in times of darkness

We read the emotions of texts (intended for tweets)

Our project gets input data, cleans it, assigns a set of emotions, calculates the fraction of each emotion within that text before showing it to you graphically

The project can be used to get a better understanding of the emotions shared daily through the internet

This tool can be used to evaluate emotions shared via instant messaging daily. With our solution you will get a better understanding what your counterpart feels when texting you!

Further additions to the project may include scraping publicly available websites (Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin etc.) to evaluate how their emotions have changed over the past months.

Please use the notebook file (and not the .py file) and pull the .xlsx as well.
